# X-Team 79 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Try to assign an even work load per person. 

Share the types work assigned (everyone will code and everyone will also work on design / implementation).


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Git issues.


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We will collaborate and set up times to work together to make sure everyone is on track with the assignment.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
